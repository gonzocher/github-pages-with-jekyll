# Coding with Kids #

I'm glad you are here. For a minute there, I thought I was going to be all alone.

We are having so much fun **coding with kids** that we thought we should share the experience and see if we couldn't share the _joy_ with others, maybe even around the world.

Our plan is to issue a quarterly coding challenge and post the challenge and results here.  We will invite libraries to distribute challenge fliers to encourage their budding coders to join
in on the fun.
